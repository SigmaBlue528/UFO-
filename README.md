UFOs Report

Challenge Overview:

This project is focused on JavaScript and techniques such as table building from an array, creating filters for the table that are dynamic, and reloading the dynamic table into HTML for public consumption. Bootstrap was also used to customize the HTML page. The result is a fully interactive visualization. 

Objective:

The objective of this project is to create a fully interactive visualization with a focus on the subject matter of UFOs.

Resources:
•	Data Source: data.js
•	Software: Visual Studio 1.69.1
•	HTML code: index.html
•	JavaScript code: app.js
•	Style .CSS code: style.css

Results:

Using JavaScript and HTML we have created an interactive webpage that allows the reader to parse the data around UFO sightings. Users can search the data by filtering based on:

o	Date
o	City
o	State
o	Country
o	Shape

Filters – webpage before filtering
  •	Users can filter by date. They can do this by writing in the date value. This can also populate other peripheral data such as that seen in figure 2.

Drilling down - Recorded UFO sightings on 1/13/2010
  •	A user can also drill down from a date into a specific characteristic such as light in the shape filter. 

Specific characteristics - Recorded UFO light sightings on 1/13/2010
  •	Users may enter as many filters as wanted together and empty the filter boxes that they don’t to parse the data around UFO sightings.

Summary

During the testing phase of the webpage deficiencies became apparent. Two deficiencies that became immediately clear were:

  1.	All input fields need to be cleared to search and analyze other data.
    a.	The solution to this problem is to create a “Clear all filters” button to clear all fields simultaneously or to assign a “Clear filter” function next to each       input to clear out a specific filter. The “Clear filter” may require additional coding.
